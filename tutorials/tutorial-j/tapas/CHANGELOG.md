### Known issues
- h2gf (beta): demo script currently does not work


## [3.3.0] 2020-07-17

### Added
- h2gf: Hierarchical inference for the HGF, beta version released
- SERIA: Added the Watanabe Akaike information criterion (WAIC) as output.
- SERIA: Added computation of early and late response likelihood.
- SERIA: Added delta plots to output summary.

### Changed
- HGF: v6.0 released
- SERIA: The constraints matrix is now automatically plot by 
        tapas_sem_display_posterior.m
- SERIA: Python code is now updated to python 3.7 and the requirement file
            now uses the latest libraries (numpy, scipy, cython).
- SERIA: Posterior plots includes fits of the complete group.
- SERIA: Summaries are automatically generated when preparing the posterior.
- PhysIO: PhysIO Toolbox Release R2020a, v7.3.0
- PhysIO: removed Matlab statistics toolbox dependency for PCA by SVD implementation (thanks to Beno√Æt Beranger, [pull request 64](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/pull/64))

### Fixed
- HUGE: fixed tick labels

### Known issues
- TAPAS uses the mcmcdiag toolbox for Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics, which shadows a number of matlab built-in functions. Affected functions include: Contents.m, cusum.m, join.m and score.m. Workaround: If you use one of these functions in your own code, remove the tapas folder from your matlab path when you are not using the TAPAS toolbox.

### Fixed
- PhysIO: Bugfix RVT/HRV convolution had erroneous half-width shift
