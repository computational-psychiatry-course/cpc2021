Overview
The conceptual and practical limitations of classical multiple linear regression models of the form can be resolved naturally in a Bayesian framework. Unless based on an overly simplistic parameterization, however, exact inference in Bayesian regression models is analytically intractable. This problem can be overcome using methods for approximate inference. Here, we provide a simple implementation of variational Bayesian inference for a fully Bayesian multiple linear regression model. The code is as easy to use as classical regression implementations, such as regress(), and requires no prerequisites other than MATLAB and the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox.

Model
We consider a multiple linear regression model with a shrinkage prior on the regression coefficients. This model is a generalization of the model illustrated in: Bishop, C.M., Pattern
Recognition and Machine Learning (2005), Springer, pp. 486â€“490. We wish to infer on the coefficients , their precision , and the noise precision . There is no analytical posterior. We therefore seek a variational approximation. Please refer to the Readme.pdf file for more details.
