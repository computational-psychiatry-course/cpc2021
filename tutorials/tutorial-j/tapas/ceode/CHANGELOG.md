# Changelog
Toolbox to integrate delay differential equations (DDEs) underlying convolution based Dynamic Causal Models for ERPs. 
The method uses a continuous extension of an Euler method, resulting in a robust and fast integration of the DDE.


## [1.0] 25-08-2020

### Added
- Original release of the ceode toolbox as part of the open-source software package TAPAS.
- MATLAB functions implementing the necessary steps to use ceode within the functionality of SPM.
- A brief tutorial tapas_ceode_compare_integrators_erp.m and tapas_ceode_compare_integrators_cmc.m that demonstrate 
the confound of the standard, default integration scheme in SPM12.
- Documentation has been added in the README.md, and throughout the code
