%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Contains the configuration for the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This implementation follows the exposition in Fine, Singer, & Tishby (1998). The hierarchical
% hidden Markov model: Analysis and Applications. Machine Learning, 32, 41â€“62.
%
% The structure returned by fitModel() contains the estimated transition matrices A (responsible for
% horizontal transitions), the vertical transition probabilities V and the outcome contingencies B.
%
% The configuration is best explained by way of example, so please see the template below. Briefly,
% the model tree is configured as a cell array N of nodes. Each node therefore has its unique id,
% namely its position in that array. Id 1 (the first position) is reserved for the root node. Apart
% from that, the id has nothing to do with the structure of the tree. That is defined in the
% individual nodes by setting N{id}.parent and N{id}.children. While setting both is strictly
% speaking redundant, it is required because it is convenient and provides an additional basis
% for sanity checking. That said, while some sanity checking is done, it is your responsibility
% to define a tree that makes sense. The nodes at the bottom of the tree (the ones generating
% output) are called production nodes.
%
% Estimated quantities are the vertical transition probabilities V (called pi in Fine et
% al. (1998)), the transition matrices A, and the outcome contingencies B of the production
% nodes. Each node, except the root, has N{id}.V, containing the prior for V (Gaussian in
% logit space) defined by the mean logitmu and the variance (not standard deviation)
% logitsa. Likewise, each node, except production nodes, has N{id}.A, containing the prior of the
% transition matrix between its children, also in logit space. Production nodes have N{id}.B, the
% outcome contingency vector. V is an empty array for the root node, A is empty for production
% nodes, and B is empty for non-production nodes.
