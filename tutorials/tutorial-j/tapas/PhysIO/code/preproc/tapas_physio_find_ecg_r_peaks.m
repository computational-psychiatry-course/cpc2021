function [events, ECG_min, kRpeak] = tapas_physio_find_ecg_r_peaks(t,y, ECG_min, kRpeak, inp_events)
% finds ECG-R peaks in a timecourse, if MR-scanner detection failed (esp. at high field >= 7 T)
%
% USAGE
%   [events, ECG_min, kRpeak] = tapas_physio_find_ecg_r_peaks(t,y, ECG_min, kRpeak,
%       inp_events)
% 
% Given a timing vector and the corresponding ECG-timecourse, the user
% chooses a specific R-peak patttern with the mouse, which is then re-found
% in the time series to detect all R-peaks
%
% INPUT
%   t           - time vector
%   y           - ECG time course, same length as t
%   ECG_min     - threshold for smoothed time series (middle plot) to be regarded as R-peak
%   inp_events  - scanner suggestions for R-peaks (plotted for comparison)
%   k           - [optional, otherwise interactively chosen]
%                 characteristic R-peak-wave of a heartbeat(convolution kernel)
%
% OUTPUT
%   events  - indices of t where an R-peak was found
%   ECG_min - threshold for smoothed time series (middle plot) to be regarded as R-peak
%   kRpeak  - used characteristic R-peak-wave of a heartbeat(convolution kernel)
%
% USAGE:
%    [events, ECG_min, kRpeak] = tapas_physio_find_ecg_r_peaks(t,y, ECG_min, [kRpeak], [inp_events])
%
% NOTE: The approach uses a matched-filter smoothing of the time series
% with the selected snippet of the typical R-wave shape as the convolution
% kernel
